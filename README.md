# Engineering Challenge

I created this repo using CRA and used Apollo Client for fetching the gql endpoint.

I used react-table to quickly create the table, search and filter, the reason for using react table, it provides an
efficent and easy way to manage tables

Apollo client is easy to set up and connect to apis, and has it's own state management
